Game Ideas: 

First idea: Hungry Dragon 

We are a human that needs to feed the dragon with eggs, at the beginning we only have one chicken, but we need to be fast. At random times 
one of the eggs is fermented and we can hatch a new chicken but we need to be extra fast and carefull. If dragon is not satisfied with 
eggs that day, we have to feed him a chicken, if last chicken is eaten we loose the game. 

This idea can be evolutionized.
